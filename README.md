# A Hierarchical Self-Attentive Model for RecommendingUser-Generated Item Lists

Datasets of AttList from CIKM2019,

In our paper, we filter out items with frequency lower than 5. 
To study the impact of data densityon recommendation performance, we also filter out users who haveinteracted with lists 
fewer than 5 times on Spotify and Zhihu, sothat they are denser than the Goodreads dataset.

The code will be released soon!
