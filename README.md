# A Hierarchical Self-Attentive Model for RecommendingUser-Generated Item Lists

Datasets of AttList from CIKM2019, which have been de-identified. No real user id, list id and item id are released, no worries!

In our paper, we filter out items with frequency lower than 5. 
To study the impact of data density on recommendation performance, we also filter out users who have interacted with lists 
fewer than 5 times on Spotify and Zhihu, so that they are denser than the Goodreads dataset.

The code will be released soon!
